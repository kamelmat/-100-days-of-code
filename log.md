# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I am reading a full description of how Github works and intend to do ano hour of code when I finis, I will keep you  posted. 

**Expanding on that progress:** 
Wow! So it looks today was a lot more useful than I thought. Even though I ended up asking AI for some idea for code... since I didnÂ´t really know what to do, I was quite entertained, realizing I didnÂ´t know how to start a codespace from scrathc, I did but then I didnÂ´t have the option to view my code in browser (If I do I donÂ´t yet know how to) so I had to fork (this I knew how to do) a repo from 4geeksacademy where IÂ´m learning *(2nd week bootcamp now)* in order to get the code from there to use the Python server. 

I made some readme on that repo. with a picture and a phrase by great Zen Master Shunriu Suzuki using markdown option that I learnt yesterday. 

**Thoughts:** 

I didnÂ´t really know how to tackle this, I probably havenÂ´t figured it out yet, but IÂ´m determined to learn!

### Day 2: March 15th, 2024

**TodayÂ´s progress** Well today I am extremelly frustrated, I tried finding free excercises on the web, and couldnÂ´t really find anything yet. 
I ended up on excercism and it looks like a really cool page, with lots of free excercises but too complicated for my level right now. 
I decided to dig into the excercises for JavaSacript which has made my life really hard on the pre-work for Full Stack Dev. Program I am in (about to finish 2nd week now). Not sure if it is the ammount of information being thrown at me or what but it was really hard solving the cipher excercise. I actually canÂ´t claim I did. IÂ´ve been trying various functions but didnÂ´t really sole anything. I asked Chat GPT for help and it did, and honestly didnÂ´t understand what it did. I really need to find easier excercises, maybe redo the ones from the preworkðŸ¤”.
Anyway, not worried since in half an hour i go into 3 hours of course and we have at least an hour coding... Plus the hour I just did, which was not only coding but reading how to code... anyway...
Frustrated so far today-

**Thoughts:**
I need to get proper excercises that fit my level
